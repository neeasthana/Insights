# Insights

How many times have you gotten a nugget of wisdom from a teacher, book, or friend that you want to implement in your daily life? Maybe you want to spend more time with your family or pursue your passions or maybe just live more purposefully than you do now. But if you're like me then you will live by this advice for 2 or 3 days then completely forget it the next days! 

Insights is an Android Application, web app, and Amazon Alexa Skill to help users remember this advice that they were given. Insights hopes to help you live the life you want to live by writing down and reminding you of the advice that was given to you. Everyday one piece of advice from your list is delivered to your inbox or apart of your Morning Update on Alexa to remind you to live the life you want to live. 

Join us and lets live a more purposeful life.
